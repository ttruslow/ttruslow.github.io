Hello! I'm a senior Computer Science major at the University of Mary Washington. This blog is a way for me to show what I'm working on, and any cool tips I've found to help me. My hope is that these posts will provide some help to others who may be working on the same types of projects as me, or students who are trying to learn this information. Thanks for visiting!
